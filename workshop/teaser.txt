Go
Do you want to have the speed of the C-languages without bothering with memory issues?
Want to be able to write an http server in 20 lines or highly efficient concurrent code with little hassle?
Then learn go - the language behind tools such as Gmail, Kubernetes, Docker, InfluxDB, Dropbox and more.
